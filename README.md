# week-4-game

The Crystal Collector game has a target number to reach that is a random number between 19-120.

The player's score starts at 0.

There will be four images of crystals displayed on the screen, with each one adding an amount to the player's score when clicked.

Each crystal is assigned a value of a random number between 1-12.

If the user can match their score to the target number, then they win. They are told on the screen that they won, and their wins will increase by 1.

If the user goes over the target number, then they lose. They are told on the screen that they lost, and their losses will increase by 1.

When either the user wins or losses, the game is reset. The player's score is set to 0, a new target number (random between 19-120) is shown on the screen, and each of the crystals is assigned a new value (random number between 1-12).

The player can continue to play the game for as long as they want.
